# Windows Setup and Run Guide

This guide covers running the Windows BLE daemon (`claude_usage_daemon_windows.py`) on native
Windows hardware. It is scoped to Phase 2: manual run from a PowerShell terminal, no tray icon,
no autostart, and no packaged executable (those come in a later phase).

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Native Windows** | Must run on real Windows — not WSL. The script prints a warning and BLE will not work under WSL. |
| **Python 3.11+** | Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed. Ensure "Add python.exe to PATH" is checked during install. |
| **Claude Code installed** | Install Claude Code and complete `claude login` so credentials exist on disk. |
| **Clawdmeter powered on** | The device must be on and showing its Bluetooth waiting screen before the daemon starts. |

### Where are my credentials?

`claude login` writes the OAuth token to (first match wins):

1. `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` — primary path (confirmed by Claude Code docs)
2. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude\.credentials.json` — fallback
3. `%APPDATA%\Claude\.credentials.json` — fallback

The daemon probes these paths in order. You can also set `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` to an
absolute path or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a directory to override the search entirely.

> **Security note:** The credentials file contains your OAuth token. Never share its contents
> or embed it in scripts. The daemon reads it from disk and redacts it in all log output
> (e.g., `sk-ant-…XXXX`).

## Setup (one time)

Open a PowerShell terminal and `cd` to the repository root.

**1. Create a virtual environment**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

**2. Activate it**

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you see a scripts-execution-policy error, run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
Then repeat the `Activate.ps1` step.

**3. Install dependencies**

```powershell
pip install -r daemon\requirements-windows.txt
```

This installs `bleak` (WinRT BLE) and `httpx` (async HTTP for the Anthropic API).

---

## Running the daemon

With the venv active and the Clawdmeter powered on:

```powershell
python daemon\claude_usage_daemon_windows.py
```

### Expected console output

```
[HH:MM:SS] === Claude Usage Tracker Daemon (BLE, Windows) ===
[HH:MM:SS] Poll interval: 60s
[HH:MM:SS] Scanning for 'Claude Controller' (8.0s)...
[HH:MM:SS] Found: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
[HH:MM:SS] Connecting to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX...
[HH:MM:SS] Connected
[HH:MM:SS] Sending: {"s":42,"sr":180,"w":17,"wr":8820,"st":"active","ok":true}
```

- **No manual Bluetooth pairing is required.** The GATT data service is unencrypted; the
  daemon connects directly via `BleakScanner` + `BleakClient` with no Windows pairing dialog.
- After `Connected`, the daemon polls the Anthropic API immediately and sends the first
  payload within a few seconds of connect (warm token path). With a valid, non-expired token
  the device should leave its waiting screen and show session + weekly percentages within
  about 10 seconds of launch.
- The daemon then re-polls every 60 seconds while connected. If the device fires a refresh
  request (e.g., after a button press), an immediate re-poll occurs without waiting for the
  60-second interval.
- If the device disconnects or goes out of range, the daemon logs `Device disconnected` and
  re-scans automatically with exponential backoff (starting at 1 second, capped at 60 seconds).

### Stopping

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal. The daemon logs `Daemon stopping` and exits cleanly.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `Warning: running under Linux/WSL` | Running in WSL, not native Windows | Run from a native PowerShell or Command Prompt on Windows |
| `Scanning for 'Claude Controller'… Device not found` | Clawdmeter is off, out of range, or showing a non-Bluetooth screen | Power on the device and ensure it is on the Bluetooth waiting screen |
| `No token; skipping poll` | No credentials file found at any candidate path | Confirm `claude login` ran on this machine; check `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` exists |
| `API HTTP 401` | Token expired | Re-run `claude login` in a terminal to refresh the token, then restart the daemon |
| `Connection failed` | WinRT BLE initialisation issue | Ensure Windows Bluetooth is on; try toggling Bluetooth off/on in Windows Settings |

## What is NOT covered here

- Tray icon, login autostart, `install-windows.ps1` script — Phase 4
- PyInstaller / one-file `.exe` packaging — v2
- MAC-address cache / sleep-wake reconnect hardening — Phase 3
